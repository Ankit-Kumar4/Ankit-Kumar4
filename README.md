## About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm Ankit-Kumar4, a Python developer with a strong passion for web development and a specialization in the Django framework. I find joy in crafting elegant and feature-rich web applications that provide real value to users.

### Interests

- 📊 Data Science: While my main focus is web development, I'm also intrigued by data science and have used Python's data science libraries to analyze and visualize data for personal projects.
- 🔧 Open Source: I strongly believe in the collaborative spirit of open-source development. I've contributed to various Django-related projects and actively participate in the developer community.
